| Aspect                         | Challenge in Traditional Systems                                                                                                                                              | Blockchain Solution                                                                                                             |

| **Decentralization of Trust**  | Reliance on a central server or entity that coordinates activities, posing a single point of failure and requiring trust in a single server or administrator.                     | Distributes trust among multiple nodes in the network, eliminating the need for a central authority by using consensus mechanisms. |
| **Immutable Record of Activities** | Difficult to maintain a tamper-proof log of activities such as data contributions and model updates, typically requiring additional complex logging systems.                      | Every transaction is recorded in an immutable ledger, providing a permanent, unalterable record of all activities.                |
| **Transparent and Verifiable Operations** | Ensuring operations like model training and data sharing are transparent and verifiable can require extensive audit trails and third-party verification.                            | All network participants can verify actions transparently; smart contracts automatically execute and verify rules of engagement.  |
| **Enhanced Security and Data Integrity** | Securing data and ensuring integrity during transfer and processing in federated systems requires robust encryption and secure communication channels.                             | Provides inherent data integrity and security through cryptographic measures, ensuring data once written cannot be altered.       |
| **Automated Compliance and Smart Contracting** | Managing compliance with data governance and usage policies can be complex and error-prone, often relying on manual checks or complex software tools.                               | Smart contracts automate compliance and enforcement of data usage policies, reducing complexity and potential for human error.    |
| **Incentive Mechanisms**       | Incentivizing participants fairly and transparently in federated environments can be complex and requires secure and transparent mechanisms to distribute rewards.               | Facilitates transparent and fair distribution of incentives based on contributions, managed and automated via smart contracts.    |
