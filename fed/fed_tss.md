## Explanation
Initialization: Sets up the model and parameters for how many shares are generated and the threshold needed for reconstruction.
Split Weights: Uses PySyft's tools to hook PyTorch for federated learning and then splits the model weights into shares.
Distribute Shares: Simulates the distribution of shares to clients. In practice, this would involve securely sending data to clients over a network.
Receive Updated Shares and Reconstruct: Simulates receiving updated shares from clients and then reconstructs the weights when enough shares are available.


## Notes


Security: The actual security of TSS in this example depends on using a secure network layer for distributing and receiving shares, which isn't covered in this simple example.
Complexity: This example is simplified and assumes a lot of ideal conditions, such as perfectly reliable communication and honest clients.
Libraries: Depending on the exact requirements and the scale of your application, you might need more robust implementations or different libraries.
